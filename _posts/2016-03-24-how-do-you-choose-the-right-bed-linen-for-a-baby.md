There are quite a few things that first time parents tend to not even consider when they are preparing their home for a new family member, and bed linens are perhaps the most egregious example of this behavior.

The first and most important thing people need to do is make sure that whatever bed lines they choose fit the bed perfectly. There is a standardized size of 51 5/8 inches long by 27 1/4 inches wide by 5 1/2 inches thick, which is referred to as "standard size", but some crib mattresses and linens decide to paint outside the lines, making it important to check everything to be positive it will match perfectly.

Of course, its also important to understand why the linens need to fit so perfectly. Any responsible parent will of course know about Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, but many will have no idea that one of the many possible causes of SIDS under 12 months are ill fitting linens. If the sheets are too loose, they could cause suffocation, overheating, or tangling in their folds. To this effect, the mattress needs to be firmly planted inside the crib with no possible movement.

Size is not the only important choice that parents have to make when it comes to bed linens however. Parents always want the things that are best for their child, and the sheets should not be an exception. When browsing bed linens, parents should make sure to get the sheets that will be the most comfortable for their baby. For those not too familiar with the differences when it comes to sheets, the most comfortable tend to be 100% cotton sheets, or at the very least a high-cotton blend. In addition, many parents are now using organic fabrics, since babies tend to have their skin irritated by the artificially generated chemicals in most of the sheets found on the market.

The final thing to consider is purely aesthetic. When the baby makes the transition to a toddler and therefore to a toddler bell, most parents will have the sheets make the transition as well. To this effect, parents should be sure that the images on their child's sheets will remain both appropriate and appealing through their years as a toddler, unless they want to buy another set of sheets sooner than necessary.

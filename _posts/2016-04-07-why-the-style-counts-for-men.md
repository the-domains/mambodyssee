Have you ever wondered what it means your first impression when you walk into a room, you walk down the street and meet new people? I'll give you the answer if you have not guessed by now. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/be63c039-b616-4322-a926-dd529e8caae9.jpg)

It's all nonverbal gestures you transmit them unconscious. In the first 10 seconds, you already disclose more about you than you can imagine. Some may be true; others are false. 

I'll give you a hint. 

Remember, when you walk on the street being rushed to get to pay a bill or to get to work, how much matter how you were dressed? Just happened to wake up one morning reluctantly, and you get the clothes you've thrown away the night before. 

Do you remember how many people were looking at you? 

No one. 

You were stepped on, pushed from one place to another as if they all wanted to go through you. That's because you have not imposed respect, by the way, you were dressed. 
> 
> Dressing well send the following message to others: I take care of myself.

The only method by which you will learn how to look good is to read, then go out and try the things you've read. Even though you will make many mistakes, life goes on. 

Do not be afraid to express your personality through your style! Imagine that how you dress can influence the kind of people you would like to have in your life. 
> 
> People judge each other by the way they are dressed. 

Therefore, if you want more from life both regarding material and spiritual things, you have to express it by any means. If you think you are a good person, smart, unique, that others would want to know then ... nothing to be ordinary dressed?

I want you to meet someone, average man. Description: It's a nice guy, get along with everyone, but seen on the streets guys who draw attention and did not understand why. 

Invent all kinds of excuses to justify that it is never in the spotlight: I am ugly, not tall, I have no money, etc.

Also, when it comes to women, they do not feel attracted to him. I wonder why? It could be several factors of which he is unaware. The tone of voice, bad taste in clothing items matching or uncertainty shown by gestures.

We all have twitching, unconscious gestures that suggest that we are not sure of our capabilities. Some of us may fail to confront others eyes when talking to them. 
> 
> The only thing I want you to learn from this article is the following: you can change anything at you: gestures, clothes, ideas, attitude.

If you have the passion for fashion and style, some people will think I'm a person full of charisma, unstoppable, showing correctly all the time. But sometimes I stay at home unshaven and wear clothes that are more comfortable than fashionable.

Two of my hobbies are style and how to improve ourselves in an interpersonal relationship. I like to learn, to analyze these things and try to share what I have learned because I like to help people more than anything else.

I think everyone can be charismatic to be liked by everyone, the kind of man that you will enjoy to have it around you. 
> 
> The most important thing in life for me is to develop myself on this plan and to help others do the same.

Each item of clothing you will wear says something about you. Even if you wear your favorite costume, you will think you will communicate with style and elegance, but may not do anything but look like you're obsolete and without taste in clothes, unless you wear it correctly.

Remember how many times you judged women the way they look. And they do the same thing, only they analyze things ten times better than us men.

Most men submitted minimal effort when it comes to their image and think about why women do not consider them attractive.

The truth is that we all want to look good, feel better and be more attractive to the opposite sex, just as we are not accustomed to talking about how we behave and different outfits. Women talk all the time about it, sharing fashion tips and tell each other what their clothes are not good for them.

To improve your style, you must stay classy with your friends, get inspiration from actors and singers outfits and make your notes of what do you think would look good. Even if you have no money to spend at the moment, you can go to try all the garments that you want, and you can start actually to save money to buy them, or find similar but cheaper clothes.

A very simple way to get a quick tip is to ask a friend who is good at clothes to accompany you when you are going shopping. 

She will say her opinion and give some advice before you decide to buy you anything. All women will have different opinions. 
> 
> Be sure it's the kind of woman you want to impress.

If you have a girlfriend or a wife, do not let her buy you clothes. WHY? For the same reason, she did not send you to buy her clothes.

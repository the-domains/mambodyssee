You are on your way home from the hospital, and you realize that you have forgotten to ask the nurse how to bath your baby. The thought of taking care of a brand new life may seem a little scary, especially for new mothers. When it comes to bathing your baby, you may worry that the water and soap will make your baby too slippery to handle. By following some basic guidelines, you can help make bath time with baby safe, pleasant, and fun.

## When should you first bath your baby?

Your baby's first bath should be within the first week or two of leaving the hospital. Until the umbilical cord falls off and heals, you should only give your baby sponge baths. To make your baby's first bath as comfortable and stress free as possible, make sure you have the following items before you start:

* Towel
* Clean soft washcloth
* Tub with water
* Soft brush
* Basin

Before you bath your baby, make sure that you choose a warm room for the bath, as babies lose body heat a lot faster than adults. Place your baby on a flat, stable surface, making sure to lay the baby on a towel or padded area.

**Remember that if the surface is above floor level, keep one hand on your baby the entire time.**

### What temperature should the water be at?

Make sure to check and double check the water temperature before you bath your baby. Use your wrist or elbow to check the water temperature, making sure that the water is warm, not hot. As you begin the bath, leave your baby wrapped up in the towel, exposing only the areas that you are washing. This will help avoid your baby losing too much body heat.

### What part of your baby do you wash first?

Begin the bath by washing your baby's eyes with water only. Use one corner of a clean soft washcloth to wash one eye and a different corner to wash the other eye. Clean the other areas of the face thoroughly, such as the ears, nose, and mouth, with water. Once finished, add a small amount of baby soap and wash the baby's face, hair, back, belly, arms, and legs. The final area you wash will be the genital area. Dry your baby completely, put on the diaper, and dress the baby in warm clothes.

## When do you bath your baby in a tub?

Your baby is ready for a tub bath after the umbilical cord has fallen off and healed. Fill the baby tub with three inches of warm water and follow the same steps as the sponge bath.

**Make sure that you never leave your baby unattended while in the tub, even if it is only for a minute.**

The time that you spend to bath your baby does not have to be scary or stressful. Once you get past the initial butterflies, you will begin to cherish your baby's bathing time. If you have any questions, please let us know, and we will be more than happy to assist you.

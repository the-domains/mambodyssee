Interest in style, for clothing, in general, grabbed the attention of men, as was natural to happen. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3be6b8f7-32dd-49d2-ae75-f62a785331dd.jpg)

How many times have you wondered?

> "what I wear to the office today?" 

or 
> 
> "I have an important interview, how should I introduce myself?"

It becomes evident that sneakers, jeans, and the shirt that made the uniform in college, club or park can't be used with the same success at work or in a more formal attire. 

Therefore, we prepared some ideas and tips to help you build your styles consistent and approachable for the office. 

We will summarize only the details of smart casual / business casual. 

## Shirt

Shirt is a necessary element for a smart casual or business casual attire, it is different from the one you dress in your free time by cut and neckband type.

For the office, it is better to wear a shirt with slim-fit cut and relatively sharp collar if your silhouette allows. 
> 
> Avoid if possible loose shirts with exotic prints in vivid colors (pink, purple, green).

Rather, choose a shirt with stripes for combined coolness at the office or, why not, replace it with a polo shirt. 

## Coat / jacket 

Forget the jacket that closes with three pins. Instead, turn towards a jacket with two buttons that dress well on anybody. If you have a firm constitution, wear the jacket that closes with one button. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/57551340-99c6-4093-be3c-7da2e72943a3.jpg)

Always beware of color, avoid black and demanding lapels that are suitable for events that happen at night.

Another viewpoint is the length of sleeves; they do not have to be long to get up close to your fingers, but not too short to leave to see too much of shirt cuffs. 

## Pants

In this case, things are pretty simple if you avoid the following: loose trousers, high waist, too tight and very colorful. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e8e0bc29-3b8f-47a0-a55c-230766588762.jpg)

You can wear suit pants or for a more relaxed outfit, choose the type of doc or cotton called Chinos

## Shoes

First detail you need to follow when picking a shoe is the tip, which can be four types: round, square, sharp and very elongated. 

We advise you to forget the last three models and always choose a shoe with round or at least rounded tip. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/21cb5a0d-adb0-4b25-b2fe-8c06329ffae6.jpg)

At the office, you can choose leather models, but is always welcome for a smart casual outfit to match it with a suede leather or textile materials shoes.

Avoid going to the office wearing sneakers (trainers), they are worn only during sports activities... 

## Jeans

Jeans in many cases are still a taboo subject. We want to wear them to the office, but nobody talks about it. 

Jeans pants can be considered suitable or not depending on where you work, because each company / industry, they have policies and regulations relating to this item of clothing.

Before going dressed like that to work, make sure you are aware of the rules required by the employer and if you are among the lucky ones who can wear jeans during working hours, then try a classic cut in a darker color and avoid baggy models or those with applied pockets.

By doing specific vocabulary exercises repeatedly a child has the opportunity to mentally store the information he or she has learned. If the child develops and/or maintains a sense of enthusiasm for learning the meaning of new words there is a good chance that he or she will retain and subsequently utilize the newly learned words.

## Reading Newspapers, Magazines and Books

One way to expand your child's vocabulary is to have him or her read various types of printed materials, especially types that would not ordinarily be read by the child. A fun and interesting exercise is to have your child regularly choose ten unfamiliar words then look up and recite the meanings. By reciting the meanings aloud it provides a sense of recognition for the word and reinforcement for the memorization process.

## Flash Cards

Vocabulary flash cards are very effective vocabulary learning tools. These cards usually have a word in large print on one side and the answer on the reverse side. This tried and true method of vocabulary enrichment works especially well with younger children, who often have fun learning this way.

## Utilizing Online Vocabulary Resources

There are many online resources that offer free vocabulary enrichment exercises and free vocabulary software. A wide assortment of vocabulary improvement methods are available through these resources.

## Maintain a Household 'Word of the Day

A fun and easy way to enrich your child's vocabulary is to have a new 'household word' chosen every day. Different members of the household can take turns choosing a word which can be written down on a piece of paper or on a blackboard. The word and its meaning can then be discussed by members of the family.

Accessories add the class, style, color and creates a real personality. One such accessory is the watch that is designed to complement the outfit, but simple wearing is not enough.

> For added style, a watch should be balanced with the outfit.

For example, before purchasing a watch, think of other jewelry that you will wear next to it, such rings and cufflinks. If you own a collection of cufflinks and gold rings, maybe you should buy a gold watch.

When choosing a watch, it must match your constitution.

Those who have small and delicate wrists must bear little clocks and those with thick wrists, vice versa.

Secondly, even if some people look good wearing stainless steel, white gold or platinum, choose the metal not only in terms of price, but consider skin tone.

> Another aspect to be thought is the watch strap.

Watch straps are available in a wide range and to suit everyone's taste.

Watch straps can be from crocodile, alligator, rubber, textile, plastic, fabric, rubber with steel inserts, white gold or steel. One suggestion is that at purchase to ask from where you can get replacement bands. It is much cheaper to own a quality watch and more straps.

Some simple rules for matching are: silver is matched with black, gray and blue. If you go to gold, will merge with brown, beige, tan and other earth colors. If you own a black or gray suit, then black strap watch is the best, but for brownsuitsyou must choose a watch that has a brown belt. The silver belt goes well with all shades of suits mentioned above.

It's not enough to match the belt with your outfit.

> Even if you wear the best pair of shoes and a stylish shirt you'll not be taken seriously if you do not have the right watch.

The elegant watch should preferably be analog, not digital because it offers a classic outlay. It should be worn only at formal events.

The casual clock must have a broad leather belt, analog or digital and is perfect during the day and night out.

Digital sports watch is usually waterproof and necessarily must have a stopwatch. It fits very well with sports attire.

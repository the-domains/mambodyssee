They became famous in the nineteenth century. 

## This type of shoe can take several forms: 

-- Full Brogue Oxford (or wingtip) with W-shaped toe, which imagines two wings:

Derby shoes 

In America and England most common name of these shoes is Bluchers after Prussian Marshal, which together with Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. 

Derby shoes / Bluchers are in the same variants as Oxford: simple, Capto, punched Capto, etc. Unlike Oxford, these shoes are not as elegant and can be worn by who is not forced to wear Oxford. Also, they are more comfortable: ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/980e06f61133b3ce03d211f713a0598b01736f36.jpg)

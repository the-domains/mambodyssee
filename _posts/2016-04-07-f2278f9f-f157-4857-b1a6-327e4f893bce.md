They became famous in the nineteenth century. 

## This type of shoe can take several forms:

Derby shoes 

In America and England most common name of these shoes is Bluchers after Prussian Marshal, which together with Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. 

Derby shoes / Bluchers are in the same variants as Oxford: simple, Capto, punched Capto, etc. Unlike Oxford, these shoes are not as elegant and can be worn by who is not forced to wear Oxford. Also, they are more comfortable: ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6c08f364-f3e4-4833-aade-b6dd69a8fe63.jpg)

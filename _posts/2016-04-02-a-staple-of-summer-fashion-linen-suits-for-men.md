## History of Linen Suits for Men 

In the early 1800s, the newest suit started to become the staple of fashion that it currently is today. In those early days of fashion, suits tended to be thicker and made from friendly materials like tweed, flannel, and wool. Those were much too warm for summer during those days before the air conditioner, and thus the linen suit was developed.

Made from the flax plant, linen was able to be made into suits that would keep men cool and retain their shape during the heat of summer. In those days, you could distinguish class by the color of linen suits for men. The rich wore white or light-colored suits, but the working classes wore darker colored linen suits because they were easier to keep clean. That is where the tradition of wearing white suits during the summer came from.

These days, the fashion of wearing exclusively white lines suits has gone by the wayside. Having said that wearing a white linen suit during the summer is a great vintage look. If you pair it with a Panama or boater hat, it will complete the classic look. 

However, if you want to go for a more modern look, there are many different ways you can wear a linen suit today. The most popular color for linen suits these days is blue. You can go for a light or pastel color for a casual and elegant look. You can also go for a more deep navy color. A very modern style of linen suits for men right now is the gingham pattern. The key is to pick a color and style of linen suit that suits you and makes you look good.

You also can mix and match linen suit components. Pairing a linen suit jacket with jeans gives you a great look. Likewise, you can match linen trousers with a T-shirt for a great casual look. Feel free to experiment with linen suits for men to create new looks.

One thing to be careful with when wearing suits made from linen is to avoid pairing them with linen shirts. Using a different fabric for the shirt is important. If you use linen for both the shirt and the suit, it will create a lack of texture that is unappealing.

## Taking Care of Linen Suits 

Just as with your traditional suits, you want always to be sure to take linen suits to a professional dry cleaner when they are soiled.

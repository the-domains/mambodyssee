Men's suits are about impressing people and fitting by looking right, which can only be achieved if you take some time to consider the finer points of how you wear the suit and how it fits you. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6744d826-1487-4f42-aff6-5d4ab53f0141.jpg)

  
With just taking some simple measures when you buy a suit or wear one, you can go from looking as if you have no idea how to dress yourself to being the master of sophisticated style.

## 1\. Remember: Your socks should match your suit

The socks that you wear with your blazers should be the same colour as your suit's trousers. 

If you're unable to find a pair thatmatchthe shade of your pants, then your best thing you can do is to wear a pair of black socks. 
> 
> Never, ever, wear sports socks with a suit.

## 2\. Your shirt's sleeves

When you're going to all the bother of wearing a blazer that fits you properly, don't do it the injustice of wearing a shirt with buttons on its cuffs. 

Having found a shirt that requires cufflinks to fasten its cuffs, the shirt's sleeves should hang a quarter of an inch below the sleeves of your jacket.

## 3\. Waistcoats - a real choice

Waistcoats have been seeing a resurgence in popularity of late. They're appropriate to wear to anything you would wear a blazer to normally. 

Certainly they have an advantage when the weather is colder, and should you often perspire from the front, and back then a waistcoat can help to camouflage this.

## 4\. Measure, measure, measure before you buy a suit

If you're going to be buying a suit "off the rack" then ensure that you take your measurements before you shop. 

Note down your neck size, waist size and inner leg length in order to have an idea of where you need to start looking. 

Should you be having trouble measuring yourself, drop by a department store that offers a free measuring service and get yourself measured before you shop.

## 5\. Notched lapels are the safest style to choose

In regards to the shape of the jacket's lapels, notched lapels are the safest style to choose and therefore appropriate for work. 

Yet, if your blazersisfor a special occasion, or you've been invited to a black tie event, you can also choose from peaked and shawl lapels for an extra sense of dressing up.

## 6\. Choose your suit's colors carefully

Off to the office in this suit? The fabric colours in the world of business are not limited, but there are shades thatan acceptable blazersshould fall in. 

Navies, charcoals, greysand andthoseshades in a pinstripe are the colours you should look for in the world of business. 
> 
> Avoid black, and garish colours. 

Shades of brown can lookgood,but check with your place of work first whether it's acceptable for you to weara brown blazers.

## 7\. Shoulder pads should match your constitution

Shoulder pads are an integral part of jackets, but you need to be careful of how big they are. 

If you're alreadybroad shouldered, you'll want to keep the size of the shoulder pads in the jacket to a minimum, but if you have sloping shoulders then larger shoulder pads give a flattering boost. 

Ideally, whatever the shoulder vest pads in the jacket, they shouldn't extend beyond the natural boundaries of your shoulders.

## 8\. Your jacket should be comfortable

Being comfortable in the formal wear you buy means that the jacket should not be so tight that it tugs on your shirt and you should be able to fit a finger in the waistband of your trousers whilst wearing them. 

This also means that the vents in the jacket should remain closed and flat against your vest when you stand.

## 9\. Single or double breasted jackets - what should you choose?

Double breastedjackets have not been fashionable for a long time. Jackets should be single breasted with no more than three buttons. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/10eb2b80-ac41-4fc0-9cf1-93d8523f963a.jpg)

  
Single breasted formal wear alsohavea slimming effect on your appearance and make you look flatteringly youthful. 

However, double breasted jackets still have a place in thisworld,and are a must for the larger gentleman.

## 10\. Shoes are an important aspect of your outfit

It won't matter at all how good your assembled Italian men's formal wear, shirt, tie and pocket square look if you aren't wearing the right shoes to go with it. 

As a generalruleblack leather shoes will go with almost any blazers, but the shape of the shoes can be tricky to pin down. 

If your feet are not particularly wide and you've gone with a formal wear that has quite a close cut, then shoes with narrow toes will work well. 

Should you have to go with a wide fitting shoe, avoid ones that end in a square toe.

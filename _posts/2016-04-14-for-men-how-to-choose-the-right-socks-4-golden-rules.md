## How to choose the right socks - rule No.1

Socks should match the color of the suit, but must have a shade slightly lighter than the color of shoes. Try to find socks and pants in the same tone (if pants are not black, of course). Pick socks in a tone brighter or darker than your pants.

> In business style, white socks are excluded. 

Light intense hues are suitable for leisure and sport. Also, avoid wearing socks with applications, with signs from animated films if you want to make a good impact.

## How to pick the right socks - rule No.2

Socks must be long. The skin must not be seen. Exposed feet turn attention, leaving room for imagination, which does not benefit anyone.

## How to choose the right socks - rule No.3

Read the label carefully. Opt for thin cotton socks of superior quality. It is allowable to contain lycra, but this material should not exceed 2%. Lycra gives durability, making them more flexible. 
> 
> Silk socks must be worn with tuxedo only. Do not amplify the intention of being stylish. 

Mixtures of wool and cotton, silk and cotton are comfortable. Thus, the skin will breathe (synthetic materials should not exceed 5% of the composition of socks).

## How to pick the right socks - rule No.4

Socks should be washed daily. To avoid the problem of the absence of clean socks, buy seven pairs of socks, to have a set for every day of the week.

## Here are a few combinations that will help you to choose the right socks:

• Gray suit- white shirt or blue, pink, ivory - tie any color - black shoes - socks in line with a tie.  
• Dark gray suit - white shirt or pale pink - red and black tie - black shoes - black socks.  
• Dark blue suit - white or ivory-colored shirt - gray or red tie - black or dark brown shoes - burgundy or gray socks.

• Dark blue suit - white shirt - tie in shades of white, red, blue - black shoes - dark blue socks.  
• Dark green costume - shirt ivory - tie in shades of green, red or brown - brown shoes - brown socks.  
• Sand-Colored suit - blue shirt - blue tie - light brown shoes - blue socks.  
• Dark brown suit - white shirt, beige or pink - tie in shades of green and brown or red and brown - brown shoes - dark brown socks.  
• Costume black - white shirt - silver-gray tie - black shoes - dark gray or black socks.

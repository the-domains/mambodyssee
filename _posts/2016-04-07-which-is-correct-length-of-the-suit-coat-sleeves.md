Almost every self-respecting man has at least one suit coat in his wardrobe, whether it's casual, sport or formal. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0a27e0f9-9ab5-4b53-83ee-bb66c8b533e2.jpg)

Thus, I remembered a funny story. I recommended to a friend a tailor, where he can adjust a suit coat. The tailor has arched the suit coat and shortened the sleeves. 

## Which is correct length of the suit coat sleeve?

After trying the "new" suit coat, he was surprised by the new length of the sleeves because he had the feeling that they are wearing until mid hand. 

In fact, he held in his hand the sleeve of the suit coat because it was too long. I guess this scenario is known, or in your case, or you saw someone else.

That left is not equal to the right. This means that one hand is shorter and another one longer. There is no reason for anxiety because the differences are not very visible.

There must be a correlation between the suit coat and the shirt sleeve so you can see at least 1 or 2 inches of shirt cuff. The sleeve of the suit coat should end at the wrist. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fd068c43-ff58-4517-bb49-ab7d1c40a537.jpg)

This detail will reveal about yourself that you pay attention to details. Also, if you wear bracelets or watch, shirt cuff should cover at least part of the accessory.

To better understand the relationship that should be between the cuff of the shirt and the sleeve of the suit coat, I invite you to take a look at the picture below!

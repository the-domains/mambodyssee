<p>Healthy food to consume during pregnancy include fresh fruits and vegetables. The nutrients in fresh foods are more abundant than they are in processed foods. If fresh items are not readily available,the next best source is frozen. Greens such as broccoli and spinach are rich in vitamin B which provides the mother with benefits to her immune system as well as added energy for her day. Spinach is also rich in iron which contributes to healthy blood and tissue formation.</p><picture>

<p>Of course calcium is an essential nutrient for expectant mothers to ingest. This nutrient is found in dairy products such as cheese, milk and yogurt. These same products also contain protein which is essential in helping the organs and muscles of the baby to develop properly. An unfortunate side effect of dairy products on the mother is often constipation. To counter this side effect the mother to be should drink plenty of water and eat foods made from whole grains such as bran. The roughage obtained from some vegetables such as celery and carrots, can also help clean out the digestive tract.</p><p>Another point to keep in mind when choosing foods to eat during pregnancy is to stay within the doctor recommended limits for weight gain. It is more important to choose foods for their nutritional value than for their calories. Women who find they are gaining too much weight can choose foods that have lower fat content such as skim milk and low fat cheese. Lean meats and healthy carbohydrates will also help keep weight gain at an even pace. A woman can enjoy the time she is pregnant by making food choices that will benefit her body and her developing baby in a positive manner.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">What to Eat if You Want to Have an Easy Pregnancy</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
